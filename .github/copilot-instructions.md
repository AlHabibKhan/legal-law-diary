### MCP & Skills awareness (GitHub Copilot Toolbox)

_Last synced: 2026-07-15T12:43:19.472Z._

- **Full report:** `.github/copilot-toolbox-mcp-skills-awareness.md` in this workspace (auto-overwritten on each scan). Use it as ground truth for configured servers and skill folders.
- **MCP:** For **live tools**, use **Copilot Chat → Agent** and **trust/start** the right servers in the MCP UI.
- **When the user’s task matches a server** (e.g. “open this Confluence page” and a **Confluence** / **Atlassian** MCP is listed), **prefer that server id** and plan on Agent + MCP for actions—not only file search.
- **Skills:** Folders below contain `SKILL.md`; attach or cite paths in chat when relevant.
