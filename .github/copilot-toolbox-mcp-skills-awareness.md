# GitHub Copilot Toolbox — MCP & Skills awareness

_Generated: 2026-07-16T13:55:14.052Z_

## How to use this report

- **Saved copy:** This file is **`.github/copilot-toolbox-mcp-skills-awareness.md`** — refreshed whenever the toolbox runs an MCP & Skills scan (including on workspace open when auto-scan is enabled). It is meant for **Copilot workspace context** together with `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (which gets a shorter replaceable summary when auto-merge is on).
- **MCP:** Lists **configured** servers from `mcp.json`. **Live tool use** still requires **Copilot Chat → Agent** with those servers **trusted/started** in the MCP tools UI.
- **Skills:** **On-disk** folders with `SKILL.md`. Copilot does not auto-load them; attach `SKILL.md` or paths in chat when useful.
- **Task routing:** When the user’s request matches a server’s purpose (e.g. Confluence → Confluence/Atlassian MCP), prefer that **server id** from the tables below.

## Suggested next steps

- **MCP:** Command Palette → `MCP: List Servers` (or this extension’s hub **MCP** tab) → start/trust servers in **Copilot Chat → Agent → tools**.
- **Edit config:** `MCP: Open Workspace Folder MCP Configuration` / `MCP: Open User Configuration`.
- **Refresh this report:** run **Intelligence — scan MCP & Skills awareness** again after changing `mcp.json` or adding skills.
